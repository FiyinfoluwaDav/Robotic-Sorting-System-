# Automated Robotic System for Classification and Sorting Using Machine Vision

This project focused on integrating **computer vision**, **robotics**, and **embedded systems** to automate the sorting of products in a production environment. Inspired by real industrial challenges observed during an internship at FanMilk PLC, the system demonstrates how **AI-powered sorting** can optimize and modernize manufacturing lines.

## üîç Project Overview

The system detects and classifies products (*Milo* and *Chivita*) moving on a conveyor using a YOLOv11 object detection model, then sorts them with a 2-DOF robotic arm controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller.

### üéØ Key Features

- **YOLOv11-based Object Detection**
- **Custom-built Conveyor System**
- **2-DOF Robotic Arm for Sorting**
- **ESP32 Microcontroller Integration**
- **Real-time Classification and Action**
- **Handcrafted Conveyor Frame (Woodwork)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Products are placed on a **conveyor belt** (built from scratch with woodwork).
2. A **camera** captures an image as each product reaches the end.
3. The image is passed to a **YOLOv11 model** trained to classify between Milo and Chivita.
4. Classification results are sent to the **ESP32**, which then:
   - Activates the robotic arm.
   - Moves the product to its designated location based on class.
